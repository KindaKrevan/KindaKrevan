Welcome to my GitHub. I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer. I call myself a hacker more than anything. I don't officially know any coding languages. Instead, I know enough to attempt to understand what I am reading, but at the current time, I have no idea how to start or how to build the majority of what I see. Instead I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many, MANY prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well. I am however planning on attending a coding bootcamp here in Idaho, and hope to move into a job in a programming industry soon.

Other things about me are as follows...
* 8 year United States Army Veteran.
* 6 year Correctional Officer.
* Lifelong Video Game and Movie Fan.
* Born in the late 80s, and always wish I'd been a teenager in that time.
* Favorite Movie is Back to the Future.
* Favorite Music Genre is Synthwave (for them late night sessions in VSCode or Atom)
* I know nothing about Star Wars, except for the meme above. Come all ye haters. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
