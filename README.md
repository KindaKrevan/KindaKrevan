Welcome to my GitHub. I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer. I call myself a hacker more than anything. I don't officially know any coding languages. Instead, I know enough to attempt to understand what I am reading, but at the current time, I have no idea how to start or how to build the majority of what I see. Instead I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many, MANY prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well.

Skills: Attempted Some. Mastered None.

- 🏫 I’m currently working on going back to school. 
- 💻 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JS. 
- 🪖 8 year United States Army Veteran.
- 👮 6 year Correctional Officer.
- 🕹️ Lifelong Video Game and Movie Fan.
- 🕰️ Favorite Movie is Back to the Future.
- 🎵 Favorite Music Genre is Synthwave (for them late night sessions in VSCode or Atom)
- 🏴‍☠️ I know nothing about Star Wars, except for the meme above. Come all ye haters.
