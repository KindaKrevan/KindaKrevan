I'm not going to lie, that's all I know about Star Wars. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Anyway... Welcome to my GitHub. I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer. I call myself a hacker more than anything. I know enough to understand what I am reading, but have no idea how to start or how to build the majority of what I see. Instead I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many, MANY prior years of World of Warcraft and developing addons.
