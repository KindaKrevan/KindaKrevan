### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm Kyle! Welcome to my Github!

Welcome to my GitHub. I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer. I call myself a hacker more than anything. I don't officially know any coding languages. Instead, I know enough to attempt to understand what I am reading, but at the current time, I have no idea how to start or how to build the majority of what I see. Instead I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many, MANY prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well.
