## Hey! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm Kyle! Welcome to my Github!
I am nowhere near what you would be able to call a developer... yet. I call myself a hacker more than anything, although not in the traditional media sense. Although I don't "officially" know any coding languages, I instead know enough to attempt to understand what I am see. I look at code for a long time and try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well.

## Stuff to know about me:
- I am an 8 year United States Army Veteran.
- I was a Correctional Officer for 6 years.
- I am a Hockey fan. San Jose Sharks & Idaho Steelheads
- I am huge video game fan. I love exploring new worlds, and sometimes that is with other people. 
- I love gaming LAN parties and conventions.

## My favorite things:
- Hobbies: Spending time with my wife and kiddo while we go camping, play games, spend the day at the water park, or just chill. 
- Games: Halo, Destiny & Cyberpunk 2077.
- Movies: Back to the Future, Shawshank, Blade Runner, The Matrix, and the MCU.
- Music: Rock, Metal & Synthwave.
- Favorite things to hate: Drinking, smoking and bar hopping. I'd rather stay home.
